The project is going to be a website/webapp which acts as an engineering guide to all the students studying under
PES. It’s going to consist of all the material that is required for every semester a student is studying in, it will have
the powerpoint slides, pdfs, e-textbooks, previous question papers, solutions, codes etc. It would be split year wise,
subject wise, sem wise and branch wise.
The website would also have an event page which would let students see every workshop, pesu.io, hackathons
happening, where they could go register and read about the event and details, it would also allow us to host/advertise
other college events, so students can learn and participate in all the events.
Why? We are doing this because there is a problem with the whatsapp note sharing and event sharing trend, which
makes everything unorganized and ends up being useless for the aspiring students.
We are also making this project open source so that students can make pull requests make changes and contribute
to the website.
